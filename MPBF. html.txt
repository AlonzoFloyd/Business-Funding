        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Alonzo Floyd from NYC. I attended college for business with a focus on labor relations, so I have an understanding of workers' or employees' needs. I worked as a maintenance worker for the NYPD and NYC Housing Authority for 14 years. I am currently working part-time with a company called Mom and Pop Business Funding. They provide unsecured working capital to businesses up to 1 million dollars in 1-3 days. The money can be used at the business owner's leisure, whether it's to fund projects, pay bills, real estate, or whatever they want - their money, their choice. My interests are fishing, traveling, volunteering to help people, and bike riding.</p>
